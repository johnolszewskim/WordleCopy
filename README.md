#  About

Wordle is a game popularized by the New York Times. In the game you attempt to guess the secret 
five-letter word. After each guess feedback about the letters and their position are given.
- Green indicates that the specific letter is in the correct position
- Yellow indicates the letter is in the word but in the corect position
- Red indicates the letter is not in the word

The player gets six opportunities to guess the word or they lose.

# Discussion

I enjoy playing Wordle. It is a enough of a challenge that it gets my brain working but not so
laborious that it is a bear. The logic is simple so I decided to implement the game. This 
project has been an exercise in implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It has
been a useful exercise in separating tasks between the different units in the pattern. This was
also a useful exercise in practicing SwiftUI, file I/O, animations, SwiftData, UI/UX and more.

I see this app as a platform I can build and add features to as a way to practice skills. Primarily,
I hope to add network and concurrency to the app, implement a competitive element with multiple
users. Additionally, an AI/ML feature that will allow the user to ask for assistance.
